    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Writer. Editor. Publishing Consultant.</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        I began editing in 2003 while I was completing my MFA at the Iowa
        Writers' Workshop, became a full-time editor in 2005, and in 2009
        launched my own editing and writing business. I've worked with hundreds
        of authors in dozens of genres, collaborated on ten books, written book
        proposals, articles, speeches, op-eds, and book marketing material, and
        cultivated relationships with many of the top literary agents in the
        business. The Writersá¾¿ Workshop taught me a great deal about the
        creative side of writing, but it was working as an editor and
        collaborator that taught me the business of publishing. As a writer with
        experience on both sides of the desk, I'm in a unique position to help
        you make your book a work of creative and commercial success.

        I hold degrees in English literature and philosophy &amp; religion
        (B.A.), theology (M.Div.), and fiction (MFA). I've also done
        fiction-writing courses through the Harvard Extension School and
        Boston's Grub Street Writers. Along the way I've judged writing contests
        and vetted submissions for{" "}
